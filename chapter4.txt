Hello, i am Aman. The only thing i know is my name. I am very disturbed today/these days or probably i will do nothing in my future career.
I request God to please give me some courage & change my mood so that i can study git currently.Then, finish the Redux of React lecture & the most,continue revising the syllabus of GATE examination i.e. Operating System, Probability & Statistics and Computer system architecture.
